========

A Ruby version of the popular children's game.

Objectives
--

Primarily a way of introducing us to Rspec, the challenge was to use TDD to build a simple Ruby program to play Fizzbuzz. In Fizzbuzz, the player counts from 1 to 100, but replaces any number divisble by 3 with "Fizz", any number divisible by 5 with "Buzz", and those divisible by 3 and 5 with "Fizzbuzz"
